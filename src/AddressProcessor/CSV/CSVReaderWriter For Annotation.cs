        1) List three to five key concerns with this implementation that you would discuss with the junior developer. 

        Please leave the rest of this file as it is so we can discuss your concerns during the next stage of the interview process.
        
        *) There are no tests.  As it stands the CSVReaderWriter class cannot be unit tested correctly as it would require access to the file system.
        *) It violates the Single Responsibility principle.
        *) It does not implementing IDisposable for resource management.  Closed must be called specifically and if there is an exception and could be missed by another developer.
        *) Very little error handling (though you could argue this isn't the responsibility of a text reader/writer helper class).
        *) There are two very similar Read methods with almost identical signatures.  Any changes would require duplicating the change and may not be clear to future developers which method should be used.
        *) Let's just say you can simplify the Read method
        *) Backwards compatibility would be difficult to maintain and likely involve having to overload the Read method
        *) The class is called CSVReaderWriter but in actual fact operated on Tab Separated Values
        *) Open would have to grow to a big if/else or switch statement if you needed to add additional modes (ie, Append, Rolling, etc)
        *) Unnecessary use of string concatenation in the Write method.
